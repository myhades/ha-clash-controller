A Home Assistant integration for controlling an external Clash instance through RESTful API.

This is not an implementation of Clash, but an external controller in the form of a Home Asssistant integration to assist automated network control with ease. 

This integration is my very first Python / Home Assistant project, and I’m still learning. Please expect some instability and rough edges. Feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated. If you find this project useful, consider giving it a ⭐star to show your support!

## Supported Version

This integration should work with most of the Clash clients. 
Known working: OpenClash, ShellClash and MerlinClash.

Core support:

| Core Name       | Supported |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Clash           | Partially |
| Clash Premium   | Partially |
| Clash Meta      | Yes       |

## Installation

Home Assistant Core must be newer than version `2024.4.3`. 

Choose your preferred installation method, and reboot Home Assistant afterward.

### Method 1: Through HACS

Navigate to "HACS" > "Clash Controller" or use the My button below.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=myhades&repository=ha-clash-controller&category=integration)

### Method 2: Manually

Download the repo and copy the folder `/custom_components/clash_controller` into your Home Assistant's `/config/custom_components` directory.

## Configuration

You'll need the API location (most likely with a port number) and the bearer token. Having a token set is required to use this integration.

To add the integration, navigate to "Settings"  > "Devices & services"  > "Add integration"  > "Clash Controller" or use the My button below. Then, follow the config flow.

Notes:
1. If you can't find it in the integration list, make sure you've successfully installed the integration and rebooted. If so, try clearing the browser cache.
2. If your API location is an IP address, make sure it's static or assign a static DHCP lease for it. Location changes will require you to re-add the integration.
3. This integration supports http and https. If you're using a self-signed certificate, check the "Allow Unsafe SSL Certificates" box and use it only in a secured network.

## Usage

Availability of the following entities and services varies across cores.

### 1. Entities

- Proxy group sensor (all, current latency attributes)
- Proxy group selector (all, current latency attributes)
- Traffic sensor (up/down)
- Total traffic sensor (up/down)
- Connection number sensor
- Memory info sensor
- Flush FakeIP cache button

Example call of getting available proxies:
```
action: clash_controller.api_call_service
data:
  device_id: [YOUR_DEVICE_ID]
  api_endpoint: proxies
  api_method: GET
response_variable: proxy_data
```


### 3. Additional Functions
This integration provides basic streaming service availability detection.
For this to work, Home Assistant must connect through the same proxy being tested, and this feature is off by default.
To enable/disable this feature, navigate to "Settings"  > "Devices & services"  > "Clash Controller"  > "Options".

Currently supported service(s): Netflix.

## Known Issue
If you're connecting to a Clash behind Nginx or other reverse proxy server, some real-time sensors will not work and get "unknown" state instead. I'm still working on this.

## Feedback
To report an issue, please include details about your Clash configuration such as client type, core type and core version, along with debug logs of this integration.
You can enable debug logging in the UI (if possible) or add the following to your Home Assistant configuration:
```
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.clash_controller: debug
    custom_components.clash_controller.sensor: debug
```
